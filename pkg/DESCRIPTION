Description: Simulates inoculating a small population of cells into a flask of limited capacity.  Cells divide stochastically until flask becomes confluent, whereupon a sample of cells is transferred to a fresh flask and division can continue.  Cells can divide according to the commitment theory of cellular senescence (Kirkwood and Holliday) or just have fixed (or distributed) division potentials.
