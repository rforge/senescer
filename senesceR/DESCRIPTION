Description: Simulates inoculating a small population of cells into a flask of limited capacity.  Cells divide stochastically until flask becomes confluent, whereupon a sample of cells is transferred to a fresh flask and division can continue.  Individual daughter cells inherit division potentials (number of divisions achievable before replicative exhaustion) from their mothers, suitably reduced to simulate telomere shortening.  Starting division potentials can be generated according to the commitment theory of cellular senescence (Kirkwood and Holliday), sampled from a distribution or be fixed for all cells.  Model output includes population distribution of cell division potentials at all times (and population doubling numbers) from the start of the simulated experiment until all cells have become senescent.  This includes the number (and so fraction) of senescent cells, for which division potential = 0.  Simulation of one population to complete replicative exhaustion provides a single measure of population division potential: population doublings until senescence, commonly referred to as the Hayflick limit and commonly measured in cell culture assays.  Repeated simulations can provide information about Hayflick limit distribution in response to underlying model assumptions and parameter values.
