<hr></hr>
<h3>Download R package</h3>

<p>The R package is available at its R-forge page:
</br></br>
<a href="http://r-forge.r-project.org/projects/senescer">http://r-forge.r-project.org/projects/senescer</a>
</br></br>
Since large parts of this package are a set of R functions wrapping a set of C++ functions, there are issues with compiling this package from scratch, particularly under Windows.  Currently I recommend using senesceR under Linux only.
</br></br>
install.packages("senesceR", repos="http://R-Forge.R-project.org")
</br></br>
Source code for the package can also be checked out (and built trivially under Linux) from R-forge by <a href="http://r-forge.r-project.org/scm/?group_id=1419">SVN</a>.

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p> Cell passage experiments to observe cells undergoing the transition from proliferation competence to replicative senescence are difficult and time-consuming.  Population growth masks single cell level dynamics, which are probably the most informative for learning about biological processes.  SenesceR is a computer simulation of populations of cells in a container dividing stochastically until they become confluent.  In passage experiments, once confluence is reached a subsample of cells is taken and transferred to an empty flask to continue dividing.  SenesceR repeatedly simulates passaging until no more cells can divide and the population is completely senescent.</p>
